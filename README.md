## 🔐 Security Model

### Row Level Security (RLS)
All tables have RLS enabled with policies for:
- **Internal Users** (admin, employee, freelancer): Full CRUD access
- **Client Users**: Read-only access to their own projects/tasks/assets
- **Helper Functions**: `is_internal()` for role checks

### Authentication
- Email/password authentication via Supabase Auth
- Passwords hashed by Supabase (bcrypt)
- Session tokens stored securely
- Auto-logout on session expiry

### Best Practices
- Never use service role key in frontend
- All database access through Supabase client (respects RLS)
- Input validation on forms
- SQL injection protection (parameterized queries)

## 🛠️ Development

### Adding New Features
1. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for patterns
2. Check [DATABASE-SCHEMA-REFERENCE.md](DATABASE-SCHEMA-REFERENCE.md) for schema
3. Follow existing component structure
4. Use React Query for data fetching
5. Add RLS policies if needed
6. Test with different user roles

### Common Tasks
```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start dev server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build

# Database
# Run SQL scripts in Supabase SQL Editor
# See scripts/ folder for utilities
```

### Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode
- Functional components with hooks
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Query for server state
- Toast notifications for feedback

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Profile not found" error**
- Run `scripts/verify-and-fix-tasks-select.sql`
- Ensure RLS policies are applied

**"403 Forbidden" errors**
- Check user role: `SELECT role FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid();`
- Ensure role is 'admin', 'employee', or 'freelancer'
- Verify RLS policies exist

**Tasks not showing in project**
- Clear browser cache
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify project has tasks in database

**Can't create items**
- Ensure RLS policies include INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
- Run `scripts/add-all-rls-policies.sql`

See [AUTHENTICATION-SETUP-GUIDE.md](AUTHENTICATION-SETUP-GUIDE.md) for detailed troubleshooting.
